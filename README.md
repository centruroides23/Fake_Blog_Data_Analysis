## Fake Blog Data Analysis

This application takes data from a dummy API, enriches it with fake data (generated with faker), and stores it in a SQLite database defined and managed with SQLAlchemy. The storage procedure is done after performing data validation using cerberus. The data is then queried to generate reports using Plotly.
